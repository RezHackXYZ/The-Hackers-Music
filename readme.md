## WHY?

Okay, answer these:

<details>
  <summary>When have you ever turned off repeat?</summary>
  Never. Who does that?
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Seen how much of the song is left?</summary>
  Never. What's the point? I've heard the song so many times, I know exactly where it is!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Used the skip button?</summary>
  Nope. Why would I? I like my songs!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Then why do those exist?</summary>
  Wait a minute... yeah, for NO REASON!
</details>
